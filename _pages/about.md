I am responsible for researching and developing innovative solutions for security and privacy at Symetrix and Algemetric. I investigate how different flavors and strategies of applied mathematics can support, produce and advance data-centric solutions favoring security, privacy, efficiency, and flexibility.

I started my career as a Software Engineer focused on web services and agile software development, which led me to be involved with several R&D projects from startups to government and large corporations. In the past 6+ years, I have been fully dedicated to bridging academic research to applications in the real world.

I received a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Universidade Potiguar, Brazil, and a Master's and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, USA.
