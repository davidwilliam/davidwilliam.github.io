As an experienced software engineer, industry researcher, and technollogy leader with over 26 years of experience, I specialize in translating business strategies and objectives into user-friendly, data-centric, efficient and innovative solutions. I have been involved in projects for startups, government entities, and large corporations across various industries.

For the last nine years, I have focused on combining advanced data utilities with security and privacy to bridge scientific research to real-world solutions. I’m a firm believer in results-driven methodologies and strategies, and I’m passionate about taking a customer-centric approach to building solutions enabled by privacy-enhancing technologies. My extensive background in software engineering, traditional and agile project management, and industrial and academic research and development allows me to successfully execute a disruptive vision of value delivery to customers and partners.

I received a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from Universidade Potiguar, Brazil, and a Master’s and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, USA.
