To ease compliance and notification burdens for U.K.-based small- and medium-sized enterprises, the Information Commissioner's Office officially launched its Privacy Notice Generator 20 Aug.

The tool offers SMEs an easy step-by-step process that will create tailored privacy notices that are geared toward the business's specific role in the U.K. economy, such as finance, insurance, law, education, childcare, retail and manufacturing, as well as for the nonprofit sector.
